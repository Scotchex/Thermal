This terminal will be used for many of the stuff I will be making in the future.
Which means I'll be updating this as the number of my projects increase.
I am creating this terminal so that I don't have to create a new CLI everytime I start something new.
I find that too time consuming.

Feel free to use this terminal ; but don't forget to give some credit
If you do anything illegal with it I am not responsible and kinda not care.
Have fun.

PS : For some reason if you wanna use this, you'll have to create 2 __init__.py files for it to work in the folders ; func and build. 
Hopelly after the first time you try to run it the IDE will automatically create whatever is needed.
